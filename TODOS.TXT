OLD TODOS:
- Make placeholders in the NEW STATIC MAP (<-- we still need this) for COLORED houses, trees and cars
- Monster attack placeholders: angry monster - melee attacks, normal monster - ranged attacks (green spit)
- Monster awareness states and monster sight: monsters see player --> awareness state changes --> they attack
- Limit weapons: javascript click event needs to be limited
- Whistle action: pet comes, grabs monster and drops him at his home
- Level organization and progression: monster waves (timed events) - there will be more monsters from time to time appearing from a new wave; this monsters will be stronger than the previous wave; there are new monsters and types of monsters appearing
- A better weapon gets dropped in the map in another time
- Monster "tag teams" other monster if monster has been captured and monster breaks free again
